Subject: Telcos hacking in the early internet and Social Engineering

Duration: 13:59

**Summary**

This book is an account by Kevin Mitnick about how he started out his hacking career as a young man, with an interest in telecoms infrastructure, an aptitude for technical mastery and an exceptional grasp of human characture.

Using social engineering Kevin put his understanding of telecoms to his personal gain by manipulating telecoms personal with social engineering before the term was even in mainstream use.

This book was facinating. It helped me better understand how succeptible systems are to their main weakness - people.
