**Summary**

HD Moore invented a hacking tool, initially while working as a Security defender and struggling to find exploits that were ready/easy to utilise.

He worked on the framework in his own time and made it Open Source.

Later aquired by Rapid7 - he was bought onto the team to run the project.

Main recurring question in the podcast is - is this tool ethical and legal what with placing a tool with exploits that can be used for good and also for bad!!!
