**Summary**

Kevin Mitnick - The book shines a bright light on big data and details how organisations and storing, utilising and selling consumer data: in some cases ilegally and in most cases it's very diffult for consumers to understand.

Kevin explains (legal) methods that can be used by anyone to immprove privacy in a step by step approach. Aditionally he talks about more advanced techniques.

In my opinion it is a useful read for anyone interested in Software or Cyber Security because it aids understanding of techniques utilised by organisation, sometimes surreptitiously.
